Definition → A number n is strictly palindromic if it is palindromic in every base from 2 to n-2.
Check smallest valid base → In base (n-2), the representation of n is always "12".
Example: n=9 → base 7 → "12".
"12" is never a palindrome.
General contradiction → Because of this "12" form, no integer n ≥ 4 can ever satisfy the condition.
Special small cases → For n = 1, 2, 3, the definition itself is meaningless because there is no valid range of bases (2 to n-2) to check.
Thus → For every n ≥ 4, isStrictlyPalindromic(n) is false.

Step-by-step derivation
Take base = (n-2).
We want to write n in this base.

Do integer division. n = (n−2)×1+2
That’s because:
Quotient = 1 (since n ÷ (n-2) is just slightly above 1).
Remainder = 2 (because n - (n-2) = 2).

Construct digits.
The quotient (1) becomes the most significant digit.
The remainder (2) becomes the least significant digit.
So representation = "12".

Example check
n = 9, base 7: 9 = 7×1 + 2 → "12".
n = 10, base 8: 10 = 8×1 + 2 → "12".
n = 20, base 18: 20 = 18×1 + 2 → "12".
✅ "12" is never a palindrome → hence no n ≥ 4 is strictly palindromic.
